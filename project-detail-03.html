                            have created a buzz by organizing 2-3 tournaments a year, from school level to provincial

                            Through <strong>strategic social media campaigns and direct outreach</strong> , I
                            successfully promoted both school-level and city-level chess tournaments, <strong>increasing
                                our page followers by over 21%</strong> and maintaining an average engagement rate of
                            60%. Each tournament attracted more than 100 participants. Beyond promotion, I provided
                            guidance to a team of 15 members, helping them identify and develop their individual
                            strengths. I also led the club’s creative direction — designing visual assets and crafting
                            media content to enhance our image and community engagement

                       <P> This is <strong>the 2023 New Student Welcome event</strong>, where we organized engaging games and offered thoughtful gifts to introduce the Club to incoming students. Our goal was to promote the Club’s image and connect with more students who share a passion for chess. I took charge of inviting and encouraging new students to join — using both enthusiasm and creativity to spark their interest. I also recorded event moments and interactions for later content. Through this experience, I honed <strong> my persuasive communication skills and learned how to design offline games</strong> that are not only fun but also genuinely engaging for participants </P>

                            This is the <strong> first tournament</strong> we have organized as the new-generation management board. I took the lead on <strong>promotion and visual branding</strong>  for the tournament, so my role on-site was to capture competition highlights and interview the contestants. Through this experience, I became <strong> a full-time extrovert and energetic “cheerleader”</strong> — and made some new friends along the way! 
                          </P>

                            Our club <strong> collaborated with Hong Quang Chess Club and Nguyen Du Chess Club </strong>to conduct this tournament. We were glad to welcome <strong>over 100 high school students</strong>  from across Hai Duong city to join the event. It was a valuable opportunity for me to learn communication strategies from other talented organizers beyond my own school, expand my network, and grow more confident in a larger working environment.</strong>.
